	Competition Problem Format
	It includes a unique name of the instance, number of days of the week, number
	of weeks of the semester, and the number of time slots during a days.
	In this example, each time slot takes 5 minutes and they go from
	midnight to midnight. This is typical for all the competition instances,
	however, the problem format allows for variation.
